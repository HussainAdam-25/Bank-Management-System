# 💳 Bank Management System Console-Based in C++

This is a fully functional console-based Bank System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming principles. No GUI libraries were used; the system operates entirely through the console.

## 🏗 Project Structure

• 📚 Modular design with reusable components:

   - Utility Library

   - Input & Validation Library

• 📁 Data is persisted using .txt files as flat-file databases.

• 🔐 Role and access management implemented using bitwise permissions for flexible and efficient control.

• 🧑‍💼 The system supports client management, banking transactions, user control, and logging.

## 🧠 Core Features

• Login Logs and Security Controls

• System Lock after 3 Failed Login Attempts

## 🔐 Security:

• Passwords are stored securely with encryption.

• Login and Transfer logs are stored in text files for tracking purposes.



📂 This project is ideal for learning practical C++ programming, file handling, modular design, and system-level architecture in a real-world application.
